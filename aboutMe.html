      <h1>Hi, I'm Jisnu Hazra ðŸ‘‹</h1>
      <p class="location">Purba Bardhaman, West Bengal</p>

      <div class="about-section">
        <p>I completed my schooling at <strong>Shyamsundar Ramlal Adarsha Vidyalaya</strong> in 2022 with <strong>84.5%</strong> in HS.</p>

        <p>Currently, I am pursuing a <strong>B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering</strong> from <strong>Academy Of Technology</strong>, batch of 2022â€“26.</p>

        <p>My areas of interest include <strong>Web Development</strong>, <strong>Problem Solving</strong>, and <strong>Networking</strong>. Iâ€™ve learned <strong>C, C++, Python, HTML, CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I also have hands-on experience with <strong>Microsoft Excel</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Word</strong>.</p>

        <p>My strengths are being a quick learner, punctual, and always ready to help others.</p>

        <p>In terms of extracurriculars, I am the <strong>Designer Lead</strong> at <strong>'IEI Studentâ€™s Chapter CSE'</strong> since 2023 â€” a large community within our college.</p>

        <p>My hobbies include playing games, listening to music, and travelling. I especially enjoy playing <strong>Volleyball</strong>, which I believe enhances both physical and mental growth.</p>
